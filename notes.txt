*******
Certification Training Platforms: These platforms offer courses and study materials to help individuals prepare for cybersecurity certifications such as CompTIA Security+, CEH (Certified Ethical Hacker), CISSP (Certified Information Systems Security Professional), and others. They typically provide comprehensive coverage of exam topics, practice tests, and study resources to support certification preparation.

Interactive Learning Platforms: Interactive learning platforms provide engaging and interactive content such as videos, quizzes, simulations, and virtual labs to facilitate learning and skill development. These platforms often cater to different learning styles and skill levels, offering personalized learning paths and adaptive learning experiences.

Online Courses and MOOCs: Massive Open Online Courses (MOOCs) and online course platforms offer cybersecurity courses taught by industry experts and academics. These courses cover a wide range of topics and may include lectures, assignments, quizzes, and forums for discussion and collaboration.

Time-based Scoring	Yes	Yes	No	Yes	Yes
Flag-based Scoring	No	Yes	No	No	No
Objective-based Scoring	Yes	Yes	Yes	Yes	Yes
Accuracy-based Scoring	No	No	Yes	No	No
Penalty-based Scoring	No	No	No	No	Yes (Penalty only)

The "GameAlgorithm" column indicates whether the provided algorithm supports each of the scoring metrics. It supports Time-based, Objective-based, and Penalty-based scoring.


THOUGHTS:::
We have 2 tables:
1. Is the above (Result 2) that shows what is normally used in training platforms compared to what OUR ALGORITHM supports
2. Table to show in each flavour of our algorithm what metrics are supported and how (describe metrics)


The metrics (9,10) could be done via Game Maker and 11 (acuracy) -->QUIZ by setting wweightR=1 and all other to 0 (we care only for result)
